This bug occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback that modifies the state.  The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of state updates.  When the state is updated within the `useEffect` callback, the component may re-render before the state has actually been updated, leading to unexpected behavior or infinite loops.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Incorrect: count is the previous state value
  }, []);

  return <Text>Count: {count}</Text>;
};
```
